==Losts Test Pack==
===================
A simple pack just for testing out mods, contains just a few mods to create a simple base to test out other mods
if you are interested in the mods this pack contains, inside the doc's folder you will find a modlist
=========
=Install=
=========
I mainly use Multimc, so these instructions are based upon this, due to Curse Forge this install is now more complicated.
If you use the CurseForge app you should be able to just use the zip and it should work, I don't use the CurseForge app so these
instuctions are for MultiMC, otherwise you will have to figure it out yourself. The doc folder contains a modlist with links 
to the version of the mods you need if all else fails 

1. Click download as zip button
2. Open Multimc
3. Right click, Select Create Instance, Name as you want, Select 1.12.2 as the Version
4. Right click  the created instance, Select edit instance, Under version select Install Forge, Select 14.23.5.2860, Click ok
5. Close the window, Right click on instance, Select minecraft folder
6. Open Downloaded zip from earlier, goto doc folder, Open modlist.html
7. On page that opened up you will see a table click all the links in the "Link" Column, this will take to the download page for each mod, Download the mod repeat for whole table
8. in the minecraft folder you opened earlier go into the "mods" Folder, Open the folder where you have downloaded the mods from earlier, Copy all mods to the mods folder that was just opened
